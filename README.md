# Introduction

**HUD Instant Replay** is a small contribution to the streaming and content creators community.

Here you will find a DRA (DaVinci Resolve Archive) for [DaVinci Resolve 18](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) with a project that renders a video camera HUD, and animates some componentes such as a blinking recording red dot, a progress bar at the bottom, and an introductory "Instant Replay" title. Video files with transparency in WebM are also provided so you can set them up in OBS and use them in your streams or videos.

The font used in this project is VCR OSD Mono. Download it free at [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/es/vcr-osd-mono.font)
